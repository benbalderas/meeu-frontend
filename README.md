## About

Meeu is an app for art lovers or people who are just curious. It serves 2 purposes.
1. Complement a physical visit to a museum
2. A starting point for planning a visit to a museum and getting to know more about its art

Museum administrators register temporary and permanent exhibits to their museum, as well as adding artworks to these exhibitions. Meeu will convert artwork descriptions into small bits of information that a visitor can easily digest.

Museum visitors can look for any museum in the platform and browse the artworks in them. Meeu's differentiatior are these very short but very interesting, often not commonly heard, info bits that a visitor can use to enhance the way they look at art, or maybe just amaze thier friends with their newly acquired art knowledge
